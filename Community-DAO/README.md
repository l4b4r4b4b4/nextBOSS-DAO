# Use Case: Community AI-DAO
1. AI Urban Planning: AI-DAOs design substanabl, efficient, and aestestically pleasing communities, optimizing for quality of life and environmental harmony.
2. Resource Sharing: Enable seamless sharing of tools, vehicles, and facilities among community members, reducing waste and costs.
3. Energy Community: Collective Production of thermal and electrical energy for all private and public appliances shared over local energy grids.
4. Community Governance: Collaboration, participation in direct democratic processes governing the community.

In this use case, we have a Community AI-DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that aims to optimize urban planning, facilitate resource sharing, establish a collective energy production system, and enable community governance. Here's a list of the roles, responsibilities, and contracts involved:

1. Urban Planning AI Contract
2. Resource Sharing Contract
3. Energy Production Contract
4. Community Governance Contract
5. Membership Contract
6. Token Economy Contract

Now, let's outline the main functions and responsibilities of each contract:

1. Urban Planning AI Contract:
    - Generate and store optimal urban plans based on community data.
    - Update urban plans as new data and community preferences emerge.
    - Validate and approve construction projects that comply with the AI-generated plans.

2. Resource Sharing Contract:
    - Register shared resources, such as tools, vehicles, and facilities.
    - Manage a reservation system for resource usage.
    - Facilitate the tracking of resource availability and usage.
    - Implement penalties for misuse or damage to shared resources.

3. Energy Production Contract:
    - Manage the registration and operation of energy production systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines.
    - Facilitate the distribution of produced energy to community members.
    - Monitor energy consumption and allocate excess energy to the community grid.
    - Implement incentives for energy-efficient practices among community members.

4. Community Governance Contract:
    - Enable community members to propose new initiatives or modifications to existing policies.
    - Facilitate voting on proposals and track the outcome of votes.
    - Automatically enforce approved proposals and update related contracts accordingly.
    - Manage a reputation system for community members based on their participation in governance processes.

5. Membership Contract:
    - Register new members and store their identifying information.
    - Manage the rights and privileges of each member based on their role in the community.
    - Implement a system for member removal or suspension in case of misconduct.

6. Token Economy Contract:
    - Manage the issuance and distribution of a native community token.
    - Enable token transactions between community members for services and resources.
    - Implement staking and reward mechanisms for members contributing to community goals and governance.

Each of these smart contracts would be deployed on Cosmos blockchain platform federated with a bigger network of community DAOs and DAOs for other use cases, and would work together to manage the various aspects of the AI-DAO community. The contracts would be designed to interact with each other and update relevant information as needed to ensure seamless operation and coordination across the community.

## 1. Urban Planning AI Contract
Solidity implementation for the first contract, the Urban Planning AI Contract. Please note that this is a simplified version and should be customized and extended based on the specific requirements of your project.

This contract allows for the creation and updating of urban plans by the contract owner. Each urban plan has an ID, name, description, dataURI (which could store a link to a JSON file or other data formats containing the AI-generated plan details), and a timestamp.

Please keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and the implementation should be further refined and tested to meet your specific needs. Additionally, you might want to integrate the AI model responsible for generating the urban plans directly or through an oracle to facilitate automated updates based on new data and community preferences.

## 2. Resource Sharing Contract

Here's an outline of the Resource Sharing Contract, including steps, functions, parameters, variables, and algorithms involved:

1. Register resources: Add new resources to the contract, including relevant details such as name, description, and owner.
2. Reserve resources: Allow users to reserve a resource for a specific time period.
3. Cancel reservations: Permit users to cancel reservations before the start time, if needed.
4. Check availability: Enable users to check the availability of resources.
5. Update resource status: Allow the owner or authorized users to update the resource status (e.g., maintenance, decommissioning).
6. Track resource usage: Maintain a record of resource usage by users, which can be used for billing, reputation systems, or other purposes.
7. Penalize misuse: Implement penalties for misuse or damage of shared resources.

This Solidity implementation of the Resource Sharing Contract includes the following key functions:

- registerResource: Allows users to register new resources, including their name and description.
- updateResourceAvailability: Lets resource owners update the availability status of their resources.
- updateResourceStatus: Allows resource owners to change the active status of their resources (e.g., if a resource is under maintenance or decommissioned).
- isResourceAvailable: Checks if a resource is available for reservation during a specified time period.
- reserveResource: Enables users to reserve a resource for a specific time period.
- cancelReservation: Allows users to cancel their reservations before the start time.

Please note that the contract does not include a specific function for penalizing misuse or damage of shared resources. Instead, this should be customized based on your project requirements, such as integrating it with a reputation or token system.

## 3. Energy Production Contract

Here's an outline of the Energy Production Contract, including steps, functions, parameters, variables, and algorithms involved:

1. Register energy production systems: Add new energy production systems to the contract, including relevant details such as type, capacity, and owner.
2. Record energy production: Allow energy producers to submit their production data periodically.
3. Allocate energy: Distribute produced energy to community members based on their consumption and energy production shares.
4. Monitor energy consumption: Track the energy consumption of community members.
5. Implement incentives: Encourage energy-efficient practices among community members with incentives or rewards.

This Solidity implementation of the Energy Production Contract includes the following key functions:

1. registerSystem: Allows users to register new energy production systems, including the system type and capacity.
2. updateSystemStatus: Lets system owners update the active status of their energy production systems (e.g., if a system is under maintenance or decommissioned).
3. recordEnergyProduction: Enables energy producers to submit their production data periodically.

Please note that the contract does not include specific functions for energy allocation, consumption monitoring, and incentives. These aspects should be customized based on your project requirements, such as integrating the contract with a token system or other mechanisms to reward energy-efficient practices and manage energy distribution among community members.

## 3. Community Governance Contract
Here's an outline of the Community Governance Contract, including steps, functions, parameters, variables, and algorithms involved:

1. Register proposals: Allow community members to submit new proposals, including a description and a voting deadline.
2. Vote on proposals: Enable community members to cast votes on proposals (approve, reject, or abstain).
3. Check proposal status: Allow users to query the current status of a proposal (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).
4. Execute proposals: Implement the execution of approved proposals (e.g., making changes to other contracts or distributing rewards).
5. Revoke proposals: Enable the proposal creator to revoke their proposal before the voting deadline.

This Solidity implementation of the Community Governance Contract includes the following key functions:

1. registerProposal: Allows community members to submit new proposals, including a description and a voting deadline.
2. revokeProposal: Enables the proposal creator to revoke their proposal before the voting deadline.
